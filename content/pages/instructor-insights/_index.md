Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21A.445J_ _Slavery and Human Trafficking in the 21st Century_ as it was taught by Mitali Thakor in Spring 2015.

This course explored the issue of human trafficking for forced labor and sexual slavery, focusing on its representation in recent scholarly accounts and advocacy as well as in other media. Students examined the wide range of factors and agents that enable human trafficking practices, such as technology, cultural practices, social and economic conditions, and the role of governments and international organizations.

Ethnographic and fictional readings along with media analysis helped to develop a contextualized and comparative understanding of the phenomena in both past and present contexts. Students discussed the analytical, moral and methodological questions of researching, writing, and representing trafficking and slavery.

Instructor Insights

{{< quote "My dissertation research is on trafficking, so it’s a topic I know very well, but I wasn’t used to teaching it or explaining it to others in such detail. Teaching the class allowed me to explore many elements of the topic that I don’t study myself. It took a lot of emotional energy to teach the class, but I loved the experience." "— Mitali Thakor" >}}
