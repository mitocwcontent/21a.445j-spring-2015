Small Group Final Presentation
------------------------------

*   This final presentation (10 min.) with your small group will take place during the last week of class.
*   This is a creative and open-ended assignment based on what your group deems a topic of interest.  
    Two of the small groups will present on their action projects with the UN or ECPAT (as explained in the [Syllabus]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/syllabus) section.)

Term Paper
----------

For the term paper, students are allowed to pick their own topic. Topics may come from a class discussion that you research in depth. You are given the option of being "prescriptive" (identifying a problem and offering solutions), or "descriptive" (describing an issue using class and outside textual research).

_Outline and Bibliography_

*   Outline is min. 10 pages, written in 12 pt. Times New Roman font. You may structure your outline with bullet points and / or topical paragraphs (i.e. a rough draft).
*   Bibliography with 10 citations on your topic; at least half from class readings or recommended reading lists. Citations should follow the ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[American Anthropological Association Style Guide (PDF)](http://www.aaanet.org/publications/style_guide.pdf).
*   We will spend time in class discussing your final paper topic choice.
